This workshop will discuss core challenges and new solutions in perception and learning (P&L) for autonomous robots operating over long terms in the wild, complex and unstructured environments.
With robotics applications in the wild broadening from environmental monitoring and agriculture to autonomous driving and disaster relief, the requirement for **long-term robust, adaptive, and intelligent** systems becomes essential.
This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to share new technologies in sensor processing, scene understanding, mapping, localization, and machine learning to address the unique demands of long-term operations in the wild, including varying terrain, adverse weather, dynamic lighting conditions, and seasonal changes.
Our goal is to foster collaboration and move toward new frontiers in robust multimodal perception, self-supervised learning, online / continual / lifelong learning, simulation-to-reality transfer, and explainable AI to enable safe, reliable and long-term autonomous robots in the wild.
This workshop will feature presentations, papers, and interactive discussion by leading experts, highlighting recent developments and future research directions for enhanced long-term performance of robotic systems in the wild.

## Venue

Somewhere in Vienna.

## Call for papers

The workshop will cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:
* Long-term autonomy, persistent mapping, and online/continual/lifelong learning in ever-changing environments.
* Robust perception under adverse and dynamic conditions in the wild.
* Sensor fusion for robust, long-term state estimation and scene understanding.
* Self-supervised/unsupervised/weakly-supervised learning during long-term deployments.
* Terrain classification and traversability analysis for LoWi.
* Sim-to-real transfer and domain adaptation for LoWi.
* Foundation models and their application for LoWi.
* Safety, long-term reliability, uncertainty quantification, and explainability for LoWi.
* Novel sensors, long-term or multi-season datasets, and benchmarks for LOWi.
* Reinforcement learning for navigation and interaction in dynamic, unpredictable scenes.
* Data generation, augmentation, and active learning for challenging and imbalanced data from the wild.
* Applications with a clear focus on their long-term perception, learning and navigation challenges.
