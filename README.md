This workshop will discuss core challenges and new solutions in perception and learning (P\&L) for autonomous robots operating over long terms in the wild, complex and unstructured environments.
With robotics applications in the wild broadening from environmental monitoring and agriculture to autonomous driving and disaster relief, the requirement for \textbf{long-term robust, adaptive, and intelligent} systems becomes essential.
This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to share new technologies in sensor processing, scene understanding, mapping, localization, and machine learning to address the unique demands of long-term operations in the wild, including varying terrain, adverse weather, dynamic lighting conditions, and seasonal changes.
Our goal is to foster collaboration and move toward new frontiers in robust multimodal perception, self-supervised learning, online / continual / lifelong learning, simulation-to-reality transfer, and explainable AI to enable safe, reliable and long-term autonomous robots in the wild.
This workshop will feature presentations, papers, and interactive discussion by leading experts, highlighting recent developments and future research directions for enhanced long-term performance of robotic systems in the wild.
